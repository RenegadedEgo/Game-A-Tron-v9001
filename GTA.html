<p><strong>Name:</strong> Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rockstar Games</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> Most contentful GTA installment there ever have been yet. While GTA3 introduced gaming with open world 3d gameplay and Vice City honed the experience in its perfection, San Andreas expanded the world once more, offering huge amount of things to do.. Truck delivery missions, dating missions, gang wars, turf control, bulgrary missions, various racing mods mixed with original gameplay will easily take dozens of hours to complete! And the story which SA delivers is one of the greatest from rags to riches tales I have ever played. - Noah</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 9/10</p>
