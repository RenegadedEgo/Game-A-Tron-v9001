<p><strong>Review:</strong> To an extent I have the nostalgia goggles on for this one so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

This game is incredible! In my experience it captures all the best elements of an RTS. The fact that it was remade in HD with brand new expansions to boot just goes to show that you dont always need the flashy graphics and intense story, you just need a good game. It is so intricate and deep, down to the races, units, maps, playstyle....well everything. Its easy to pick up and play but very very hard to master, even when you think you know what you are doing theres a player out there that can counter you and i think thats fantastic. Without the dlc the base game is Â£14.99, currently thats all i have bothered with but i will be getting everything they have released going forward - James</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 7/10</p>
