<p><strong>Name:</strong> Crash Bandicoot: Wrath of Cortex</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2001</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Traveller's Tale</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Platform</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> Crash Bandicoot: The forth game in main series of Crash Bandicoot (After Warped) is in the hands of new developers, Traveller's Tales who took it from the hands of Naughty Dog. It is the first Crash Bandicoot game to not be released exclusively for a Playstation console, with Gamecube and Xbox versions of the game to come along with a Playstation 2 version. The game works like Crash 3 where you start off in a hub world with 5 sets of levels, which each set having 5 levels, meaning a total of 25 levels. You play forest levels, water levels, 3 levels where you are in a ball and spin around and flying levels. The levels require you to collect boxes, gems, relics and crystals to 106% complete the game. Yes, 106%. Good luck finding out how that works. Overall, the game is pretty fun but the levels are a little too generic and not as good as the compact levels of Crash 2 and 3. But the game is really fun nonetheless. - Matt</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 7/10</p>
