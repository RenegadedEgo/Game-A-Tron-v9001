<p><strong>Name:</strong> Tales of Symphonia</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Namco</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Japanese Role Playing Game</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> Tales of Symphonia is the fifth game in the "Tales" series. A series of JRPG's designed around real time lighting and not turned base which you would see in something like Final Fantasy. Developed and published by Namco, the game came out in 2003 on the gamecube (with a ps2 version only coming out in Japan). The game follows a boy named Lloyd Irving, a girl called Colette and Lloyd's best friend Genis and their journey to connect the two worlds of Sylvarant and Tehe'alla. In the process they are chased by an army known as the Desians. The gameplay of the game is that of any rpg, with levels, skills (called artes). The game will take you about 40 hours to complete and overall it is some of the strongest gameplay and plot I have seen from an RPG. The game ended up getting a sequal called Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World/Knight of Ratatosk. Overall, check this game out if you like JRPGS. - Matt</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 9/10</p>
