<p><strong>Name:</strong> Super Mario World</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 1991</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Nintendo</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Platforming</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> Super Mario World... what can be said about this game that hasn't been said a million times? The forth game of the series after Super Mario 3 and the first game on the 16-Bit Console of the Super Nintendo. The game follows Mario (duh) and you have to save princess peach (as usual) by the evil... bowser. Yeah the story is very generic but what the game lacks in story it has in the levels. There are 8 worlds in the game which has mario running, swimming and flying. After each world you have to fight one of the koopas which are pretty fun bossfights. Overall, the game is your same old same old Mario game, you will finish the game in roughtly 6-7 hours. But if you played one Mario game, you have played them all... - Matt</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 7/10</p>
